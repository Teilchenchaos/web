            <h3>What really is TeilchenChaos ? - August 3rd</h3>
            <p>Now that you know that there's a game about physics coming out soon, you might think, what even is this game. TeilchenChaos is an idle game where you can earn particles (quarks and electrons) and then, you can use these particles to craft neutrons and protons that you can then use to craft atoms. That's not the end, with these atoms you can craft, you guessed it, molecules. Please, take notes that this is the BASE game and that we will add new functionalities to make it better and even release updates later.</p>
